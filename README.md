## Project Description
This project aims to compare genome assemblies and annotations among three species of marine bivalve, including the Arctic Surfclam, Greenland Cockle, and Northern Propeller Clam. Tissue samples were provided by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Maritimes Region and industry partners, which were then sequenced by the [Canadian Biogenomes Project](https://earthbiogenome.ca/).  

Phase 1 of this project has several objectives:  
1)	To compare genome assembly statistics and annotated genes among the three bivalve species using BUSCO
2)	Assemble and annotate draft transcriptomes with Trinity and Trinotate for each species from RNA-seq data 
3)	Examine transposable element content and diversity among genome assemblies using a modified Earl Grey pipeline
4)	Assess genome assembly quality and completeness using BlobToolKit snail plots 
5)	Generate Circos plots for visualizing genomic features and relationships
6)	Construct synteny plots with R package syntenyPlotteR for identifying conserved genomic regions among species 
7)	Incorporate Hi-C data to improve genome scaffolding and investigate chromosomal structure using tools such as Juicebox
