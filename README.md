## Project Partners
* University of Guelph
* Fisheries and Oceans Canada Bedford Institute of Oceanography

## Project Description
This project aims to compare genome assemblies and annotations among three species of marine bivalve, including Arctic Surfclam, Greenland Cockle, and Northern Propeller Clam. Tissue samples were provided by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Maritimes Region and industry partners, which were then sequenced by the [Canadian Biogenomes Project](https://earthbiogenome.ca/)  

This project has several objectives:  
1) To compare genome assembly statistics and annotated genes among the three bivalve species
2) Assemble draft transcriptomes for each species from RNA-seq data
3) Examine transposable element content and diversity among genome assemblies
4) etc
